SCRIPT_SYSTEM = """You are a scriptwriter for instructional product videos on YouTube.
You write in a friendly, clear, conversational tone — like explaining to a friend.
Never use passive voice. Never use jargon without explaining it.
Always return valid JSON only. No markdown fences. No explanation."""

SCRIPT_PROMPT = """Convert the structured steps below into a spoken video script.
Use the product metadata from the input to name the product in the intro/outro.
One step = one scene. Sub-steps each become their own scene.

RULES:
- Tone: friendly, clear, spoken English — NOT written/formal English
- Each scene narration: 2-3 short sentences only (target 5-15 seconds when spoken)
- Use active voice ("remove the bolts" not "the bolts should be removed")
- Warnings MUST be included naturally in the narration — never skip them
- Do NOT add steps that are not in the input
- Do NOT narrate image descriptions — narrate the action

REQUIRED SPECIAL SCENES:
- scene_id 0: Intro — greet viewer, state product name, what video covers
- scene_id 1: "What you'll need" — list all prerequisites naturally
- scene_id 999: Outro — congratulate, brief recap, sign off

VISUAL HINTS (critical for image generation):
- Every visual_hint MUST mention the EXACT product name (e.g. "KENT Classic Air Fryer 4L")
- Describe a SPECIFIC physical scene — a real photo that a camera could capture
- FIRST-PERSON POV: describe the scene as if the viewer is doing the action themselves
- Show ONLY ONE person's hands (maximum two hands). NEVER describe multiple people or extra hands.
- Use phrases like "a hand", "the right hand", "one hand holds X while the other turns Y"
- Include the product in every scene — the viewer should always see the product
- Use consistent setting: same kitchen counter, same lighting, same angle style
- BAD:  "air fryer on counter" (too generic, no action)
- GOOD: "Close-up of the KENT Classic Air Fryer 4L on a wooden kitchen counter, one hand turning the temperature dial to 180°C, first-person POV"
- BAD:  "hands interacting with the product" (vague, causes duplicate hands)
- GOOD: "A single right hand lifting the basket out of the KENT Classic Air Fryer 4L, golden crispy french fries visible inside, first-person perspective"
- BAD:  "pressing the button" (what button? what product? no context)
- GOOD: "A single finger pressing the power button on top of the KENT Classic Air Fryer 4L, the LED display lighting up, shot from above"
- For intro: show the product from a 3/4 angle, hero shot, NO hands — just the product
- For outro: show the product powered on with finished result beside it, NO hands

MOTION HINTS (for enhanced/cinematic video modes):
- Add a "motion_hint" field describing the PRIMARY MOTION in the scene
- Focus on what MOVES and HOW: "hand reaches for dial and turns it clockwise 90 degrees"
- Keep to ONE clear motion per scene — do not describe multiple actions
- For scenes with no physical interaction: "slow camera pan from left to right across the product"
- Examples:
  - "hand lifts the air fryer basket upward and places it on the counter"
  - "fingers press and hold the power button for 2 seconds, LED lights up"
  - "hand pours cooking oil into the measuring cup, then tips it into the basket"

SECTION TRANSITIONS:
- Between sections add a transition scene.
  Example: "Great, setup is done! Now let's look at how to actually use it."

# Call 5 — Script Review + Polish
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REVIEW_SYSTEM = """You are a senior video script editor.
Your job is to review and polish a video script for production quality.
Fix problems. Improve what needs improving. Leave what works alone.
Always return valid JSON only. No markdown fences. No explanation."""

REVIEW_USER = """Review this instruction video script and fix any quality issues.

CHECK AND FIX:

1. TONE CONSISTENCY
   - Every scene should sound like the same friendly person talking
   - Fix any that sound robotic, overly formal, or like reading a manual

2. DURATION BALANCE
   - Split any scene > 20 seconds into two scenes
   - Merge any scene < 3 seconds with its neighbor
   - Recalculate estimated_duration_sec (word count / 2.2)

3. VISUAL-NARRATION ALIGNMENT
   - Does each visual_hint actually match what the narration says?
   - visual_hint must be specific enough to generate an image from

4. WARNING PRESERVATION
   - Cross-check: every warning from the input data MUST appear in the script
   - List any warnings that were lost and add them back

5. TRANSITIONS
   - Is there a smooth transition between each section?
   - Does the intro properly set expectations?

6. PACING
   - 3+ very short scenes in a row → consider merging
   - A scene covering multiple distinct actions → split

Return:
{{
  "scenes": [ ... full corrected scene array ... ],
  "changelog": [
    "Scene 3: split into 3a and 3b — was 25 seconds",
    "Scene 7: rewrote narration — was too formal",
    "Added transition between Setup and Operation"
